# Web Debugging and Optimization Exercise

## Overview

This exercise is designed to improve your skills in web debugging and optimization. You will be working with an intentionally flawed web application. Your task is to identify and document the problems in the provided HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

## Instructions

Copy this README.md into your Devtools REPO in a new MD file called Day-5.md

### Step 1: Identify Problems

Go through the provided files (`index.html`, `style.css`, and `app.js`). Each file contains several marked problems (indicated by comments like `<!-- Problem 1: -->`, `/* Problem 5: */`, etc.). Your task is to identify what each problem is and why it is an issue.

### Step 2: Document Each Problem

In this README.md file, document each problem. Write a sentence for each problem explaining what the issue is and why it's problematic. Use the format below for your documentation:

#### Problem 1:

- Description: [Your explanation here]

#### Problem 2:

- Description: [Your explanation here]

[Continue with the remaining problems]

### Step 3: Propose Solutions

For each identified problem, propose a solution or an optimization strategy. Briefly describe how you would fix the issue.

#### Problem 1:

- Solution: [Your proposed solution here]

#### Problem 2:

- Solution: [Your proposed solution here]

[Continue with solutions for the remaining problems]

### Step 4: Reflect

After completing the exercise, write a brief reflection on what you learned from this debugging and optimization process. Discuss any new insights you gained and how you might apply these skills in future projects.

## Submission

Submit this README.md file with all the problems documented and solved, along with your reflection. Ensure that your explanations are clear and concise.

This exercise is an opportunity to practice critical web development skills. Pay close attention to detail and think about how each issue affects the overall performance and user experience of the web application.
